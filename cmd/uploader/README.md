# Upload Service

## Overview

The Upload Service is an HTTP server used for hosting static files in [MinIO](https://min.io/). It contains a simple HTTP endpoint which accepts `multipart/form-data` forms. It uploads files to dedicated private and public system buckets that the service creates in MinIO, instead of Rafter. This service is particularly helpful if you do not have your own storage place from which Rafter could fetch assets. You can also use this service for development purposes to host files temporarily, without the need to rely on external providers.

## Prerequisites

Use these tools to set up the service:

- [Go](https://golang.org)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Usage

Read how to run and use the service.

### Run from sources

To run the service against the local installation on Minikube without building the binary, use this command:

```bash
APP_KUBECONFIG_PATH=/Users/$USER/.kube/config APP_VERBOSE=true APP_UPLOAD_ACCESS_KEY={accessKey} APP_UPLOAD_SECRET_KEY={secretKey} go run ./cmd/uploader/main.go
```

Replace values in curly braces with proper details, where:

- `{accessKey}` is the access key required to sign in to the content storage server.
- `{secretKey}` is the secret key required to sign in to the content storage server.

The service listens on port `3000`.

### Build a production version

To build the production Docker image, use this command:

```bash
make build-uploader
```

### Upload files

For the full API documentation, including OpenAPI specification, see the [Asset Store docs](https://kyma-project.io/docs/master/components/asset-store#details-asset-upload-service).

### Environment variables

Use these environment variables to configure the service:

| Name | Required | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **APP_PORT** | No | `3000` | The port on which the HTTP server listens |
| **APP_HOST** | No | `127.0.0.1` | The host on which the HTTP server listens |
| **APP_VERBOSE** | No | `false` | The toggle used to enable detailed logs in the service |
| **APP_KUBECONFIG_PATH** | No | None | The path to the kubeconfig file, needed to run the service outside of a cluster |
| **APP_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT** | No | `30m` | The file upload timeout |
| **APP_MAX_UPLOAD_WORKERS** | No | `10` | The maximum number of concurrent upload workers |
| **APP_UPLOAD_ENDPOINT** | No | `minio.kyma.local` | The address of the content storage server |
| **APP_UPLOAD_EXTERNAL_ENDPOINT** | No | None | The external address of the content storage server. If not set, the system uses the `APP_UPLOAD_ENDPOINT` variable. |
| **APP_UPLOAD_PORT** | No | `443` | The port on which the content storage server listens |
| **APP_UPLOAD_ACCESS_KEY** | Yes | None | The access key required to sign in to the content storage server |
| **APP_UPLOAD_SECRET_KEY** | Yes | None | The secret key required to sign in to the content storage server |
| **APP_UPLOAD_SECURE** | No | `true` | The HTTPS connection with the content storage server |
| **APP_BUCKET_PRIVATE_PREFIX** | No | `private` | The prefix of the private system bucket |
| **APP_BUCKET_PUBLIC_PREFIX** | No | `public` | The prefix of the public system bucket |
| **APP_BUCKET_REGION** | No | `us-east-1` | The region of system buckets |
| **APP_CONFIG_MAP_ENABLED** | No | `true` | The toggle used to save and load the configuration using the ConfigMap resource |
| **APP_CONFIG_MAP_NAME** | No | `asset-upload-service` | The name of the ConfigMap resource |
| **APP_CONFIG_MAP_NAMESPACE** | No | `kyma-system` | The Namespace in which the ConfigMap resource is created |


### Configure the logger

This service uses `glog` to log messages. Pass command line arguments described in the [`glog.go`](https://github.com/golang/glog/blob/master/glog.go) file to customize the log parameters, such as the log level and output.

For example:
```bash
go run ./cmd/uploader/main.go --stderrthreshold=INFO -logtostderr=false
```

## Development

There is a unified way of testing all changes in Rafter components. For details on how to run unit and integration tests, read [this](../../docs/development-guide.md) development guide.
